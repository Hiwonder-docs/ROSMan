## 11.2 Large Models Basic Courses

### 11.2.1 Large Language Model Courses

* **Overview of Large Language Model**

A Large Language Model (LLM) is an advanced artificial intelligence model developed to comprehend and generate human language.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.1/01/image2.png"  />

(1) Basic Concept

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a deep learning model trained on extensive text data, designed to either generate natural language text or comprehend the meaning of language. LLM is capable of performing various natural language tasks, such as text classification, question answering, and dialogue, making them a crucial step toward achieving advanced artificial intelligence. Unlike smaller models, LLM leverages a similar Transformer architecture and pretraining objectives (like Language Modeling), but are distinguished by their larger model size, greater training data, and enhanced computational resources.

(2) Features

**Massive Scale:** LLM are characterized by their vast parameter sizes, often reaching billions or even trillions of parameters. This immense scale allows them to capture a wealth of linguistic knowledge and complex syntactic structures.

**Pretraining and Fine-tuning:** LLM utilize a two-stage learning process: pretraining and fine-tuning. Initially, they are pretrained on large-scale, unlabeled text data, learning general language representations and knowledge. Subsequently, they are fine-tuned using labeled data to specialize in specific tasks, allowing them to excel across a wide range of NLP applications.

**Contextual Awareness:** LLM demonstrate exceptional contextual awareness, with their ability to understand and generate language deeply dependent on preceding text. This enables them to perform exceptionally well in tasks like dialogue, article generation, and contextual comprehension.

**Multilingual Capabilities:** LLM support multiple languages, extending beyond just English. This multilingual proficiency enables them to power cross-lingual and cross-cultural applications, enhancing their versatility and global reach.

**Multimodal Support:** Some LLMs have expanded to handle multimodal data, including text, images, and speech. This capability allows them to understand and generate content across various media types, opening up more diverse application possibilities.

**Emergent Properties:** LLM exhibit remarkable emergent properties, where performance improvements become apparent in large models but are absent in smaller ones. This makes them adept at handling more complex tasks and challenges.

**Cross-domain Applications:** LLM have been widely adopted across numerous fields, including text generation, machine translation, information retrieval, summarization, chatbots, and virtual assistants. Their influence is profound, impacting both daily life and work in significant ways.

**Ethical and Risk Considerations:** While LLM showcase impressive capabilities, they also raise important ethical and risk-related concerns, such as the potential generation of harmful content, privacy violations, and cognitive biases. As such, the development and deployment of LLM must be approached with careful consideration and caution.

(3) Working Principle

Large Language Model (LLM) are built on deep learning principles and are trained using massive datasets and substantial computational resources to develop neural networks with billions of parameters. Through iterative training and parameter optimization, these models learn to perform a wide range of tasks with high accuracy. The "**large**" in LLM reflects their immense scale—encompassing a vast number of parameters, extensive training data, and significant computational demands. This scale enables advanced models to achieve superior generalization capabilities and deliver increasingly accurate results, even in highly specialized domains.

Today, some of the most popular applications revolve around generative AI, such as language generation tools (e.g., ChatGPT) and image generation platforms (e.g., Midjourney). At the core of these applications is the concept of generation—the model's ability to predict and produce coherent content based on a given input.

(4) Application Scenarios

① Text Generation

Large Language Models are capable of generating diverse types of text, including news articles, stories, poems, and more. These capabilities make them well-suited for applications in content creation, creative writing, and automated storytelling.

② Text Classification

Large Language Models can classify text into various categories, such as sentiment analysis and topic identification. These capabilities are especially valuable in scenarios like public opinion analysis, information retrieval, and content moderation.

③  Machine Translation

Large Language Models excel at machine translation, enabling the conversion of text from one language to another. These capabilities are essential for cross-language communication, localization, and global collaboration.

④ Question-Answering Systems

Large Language Models can be used to build question-answering systems that respond to user queries. These applications are particularly valuable in areas such as intelligent customer support, knowledge retrieval, and information lookup.

### 11.2.2 Large Speech Model Courses

* **Overview of Large Speech Model**

(1) What is a Large Speech Model?

A Speech Large Model (LSM) refers to a machine learning model that uses deep learning techniques to process and understand speech data. These models can be applied in a variety of tasks, such as speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, and emotional analysis of speech. The design and training of these models typically require large amounts of speech data and substantial computational resources, which is why they are referred to as "**large models**".

(2) Why Do We Need Large Speech Model?

With the advancement of artificial intelligence and deep learning, traditional speech processing methods face many limitations. Large models leverage vast amounts of data and deep neural networks to learn and understand the complex features within speech, thereby improving the accuracy and naturalness of speech recognition and generation.

Their advantages include:

① High Accuracy: They maintain a high recognition rate even in noisy environments and with various accents.

② Naturalness: Speech generated by synthesis models is more natural, closely resembling human speech.

③ Versatility: These models support a wide range of languages and tasks, such as multilingual speech recognition, speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and emotion recognition.

(3) Development of Speech Recognition Technology

Word-Level Speech Recognition: At this stage, speech recognition systems could only recognize individual words

Phrase-Level Speech Recognition: With the expansion of data and advancements in algorithms, speech recognition systems gradually gained the ability to recognize longer phrases, such as "**Please turn on my computer**".

Sentence-Level Speech Recognition: In recent years, with the emergence of AI large models, speech recognition systems have become capable of recognizing entire sentences and understanding their underlying meaning.

(4) Differences Between Large Speech Model and Traditional Speech Processing Technologies

① Processing Methods

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These typically rely on manual feature extraction and shallow models, such as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM), to process speech signals.

Large Speech Model: These use end-to-end learning, directly mapping raw speech waveforms to target outputs (such as text or another speech signal), reducing the reliance on manual feature extraction. They are typically based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers.

② Model Complexity

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These models are relatively simple, with fewer parameters.

Large Speech Model: These models have complex structures and a large number of parameters, enabling them to capture more subtle speech features and contextual information.

③ Recognition Capability

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These are highly adaptable to specific scenarios and conditions, but their recognition capability is limited when encountering new, unseen data.

Large Speech Model: Due to their large number of parameters and powerful learning ability, they offer superior recognition capabilities and can adapt to a wider variety of speech data and environments.

④Training Data Requirements

Traditional Speech Processing Technologies: These typically require less data for training, but the data must be highly annotated and of high quality.

Large Speech Model: These require vast amounts of training data to fully learn the complexities of speech, often necessitating large quantities of annotated data or the use of unsupervised/self-supervised learning methods.

(5) Core Technologies of Speech Large Model

① Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

ASR is the technology that converts human speech into text. The core steps of a speech recognition system include feature extraction, acoustic modeling, and language modeling.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/02/image2.png"  />

Features and Specifications：

**Operating Voltage:** 3.3V (typical)

**Operating Current:** 0.8mA (typical)

**Operating Temperature:** -20°C (min), 25°C (typical), 70°C (max)

**Operating Humidity:** Up to 95% relative humidity (max)

(1) Recording and Playback Test

The following demonstration uses the Raspberry Pi 5 as an example. The connection and testing steps are also applicable to other compatible devices such as the Jetson series:

① Connection Illustration and Detection

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/02/image3.png"   />

If the main controller is a Raspberry Pi, you can use VNC remote desktop access (refer to the appendix: Remote Access and File Transfer) to log into the Raspberry Pi system. Once connected, check the upper right corner of the desktop for microphone and speaker icons. As shown in the image below, the presence of these icons indicates a successful connection.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/02/image4.png"  />

If you're using a NVIDIA Jetson device, you can connect via the NoMachine remote access tool. After logging in, check the upper right corner of the system interface for the speaker icon to confirm successful detection.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/02/image5.png"  />

② Recording Test

Next, open a new terminal window and enter the following command to check the available recording devices. Note that the -l option is a lowercase "**L**". You should see the card number (card) listed—for example, card 0. This is just an example; please refer to your actual query result.

```
arecord -l
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/02/image6.png"  />

Then, use the following command to start recording. Replace the red-marked card number (hw:0,0) with the actual number you found in the previous step:

```
arecord -D hw:0,0 -f S16_LE -r 16000 -c 2 test.wav
```

This will create a test.wav audio file in the current directory.

You can record a short 5-second sample, then press Ctrl + C to stop the recording.

③ Playback Test

After the recording is complete, you can check whether the audio file was successfully created by listing the contents of the current directory:

```
ls
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/02/image8.png"  />

If test.wav appears in the list, the recording was successful. To play back the recording, use the following command:

```
aplay test.wav
```

* **Voice Wake-Up**

In this lesson, we'll learn how to use a large speech model to activate the voice device by speaking a predefined wake word through a program.

(1) WonderEcho Pro Wake-Up

Device Check：

To proceed, we need to identify the USB device name assigned to the connected WonderEcho Pro or Circular Microphone Array (hereafter referred to as the voice device). Please follow the steps below carefully. 

:::{Note}

Do not connect any other USB devices during this process to avoid confusion.

:::

① First, disconnect the voice device, then open a terminal and run the following command:

```
ll /dev | grep USB
```

② Next, reconnect the voice device to the USB port on your main board and run the same command again:

```
ll /dev | grep USB
```

③ You should now see a newly listed USB port, such as ttyCH341USB1.  

Please take note of this device name—it may vary depending on the main controller being used.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/03/image3.png"  />

Wake-Up Test：

① To begin, update the port number used in the program by editing the script. You'll also need to uncomment the line for the port you're using and comment out any unused ports.

```
vim wakeup_demo.py
```

Press i to enter edit mode and make the necessary changes as shown below (update the port number accordingly and adjust comments as needed).

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/03/image4.png"  />

Once the changes are complete, press ESC, then type :wq and press Enter to save and exit the editor.

② Next, return to the system interface and run the wake-up demo using the command below. Speak the wake word **"HELLO HIWONDER"** clearly toward the WonderEcho Pro voice device.  

If the output includes **"keyword detect"**, it indicates that the firmware has been successfully flashed and the wake word is functioning correctly.

```
python3 ~/large_models/wakeup_demo.py
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/03/image5.png"  />

(2) 6-Microphone Circular Array

As with the WonderEcho Pro, you can connect the 6-Microphone Circular Array to your main board (Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson) using a Type-C to USB cable.

Device Check:

For Jetson users, connect to the Jetson system using the NoMachine remote access tool. Once connected, check the desktop interface.  

If the 6-Microphone Circular Array icon appears on the left side of the desktop, it indicates the device has been successfully recognized.

Wake-Up Test:

① Open a new terminal window and run the following command to edit the wakeup_demo.py script:

```
vim ~/large_models/wakeup_demo.py
```

② Press i to enter edit mode.

③ Update the port to match the device port number you previously identified. Comment out the WonderEcho Pro configuration (add \# at the beginning of the corresponding line), and uncomment the line using the circular microphone array on line 11 as the input device (see red box in the referenced image).

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/03/image7.png"  />

④ Press ESC to return to command mode, then type :wq and press Enter to save and exit.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/03/image8.png"  />

⑤ In the terminal, run the wake-up program with the following command:

```
python3 ~/large_models/wakeup_demo.py
```

⑥ After about 30 seconds of initialization, speak the wake word **"hello hiwonder"** to test the device.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/03/image10.png"  />

(3) Brief Program Overview

This is a Python-based wake word detection script that utilizes the speech module to process audio input and detect a specific wake word (e.g., "**HELLO_HIWONDER**").

Source Code Path: [/home/ubuntu/large_models/wakeup_demo.py](../_static/source_code/large_models_sdk.zip)

Importing Required Modules

{lineno-start=5}

```
import os
import time
from speech import awake
```

`os`: Used for handling file paths and executing system-level commands.

`time`: Provides delay functions to prevent overly frequent detection attempts.

`speech`: The core module responsible for processing audio input and detecting the wake word.

Initializing the wonderecho Class

{lineno-start=9}

```
port = '/dev/ttyUSB0'
kws = awake.WonderEchoPro(port)
```

Attempts to Turn Off the Cooling Fan on Raspberry Pi 5

{lineno-start=13}

```
try:  # If a fan is present, it's recommended to turn it off before detection to reduce interference(如果有风扇，检测前推荐关掉减少干扰)
    os.system('pinctrl FAN_PWM op dh')
except:
    pass
```

Purpose: Attempts to turn off the cooling fan by executing the system command `pinctrl FAN_PWM op dh`. This helps minimize background noise from the fan that could interfere with wake word detection.

Error Handling: If the command fails (e.g., due to unsupported hardware), the program catches the exception and continues running without interruption.

Main Wake Word Detection Loop

{lineno-start=18}

```
kws.start() # Start detection(开始检测)
print('start...')
```

The program starts the wake word detection thread using kws.start().

It prints start... to indicate that detection has been successfully initiated.

Main Program Logic

{lineno-start=20}

```
while True:
    try:
        if kws.wakeup(): # Wake-up detected(检测到唤醒)
            print('hello hiwonder')
        time.sleep(0.02)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        kws.exit() # Cancel processing (关闭处理)
        try:
            os.system('pinctrl FAN_PWM a0')
        except:
            pass
        break
```

During each iteration, the program checks whether the wake word has been detected. If the wake word is detected, it prints keyword detected.

The detection frequency is controlled using time.sleep(0.02) to prevent excessive CPU usage.

Pressing Ctrl+C triggers a KeyboardInterrupt, which gracefully exits the detection loop.

Upon exit, the program calls kws.exit() to stop the wake word detection process.

The fan is then restored to its original state (if applicable).

(4) Extended Functionality

Modifying the Wake-Up Response Text

In this section, you'll learn how to change the message that appears after a successful wake word detection.

① For example, if the wake word "**HELLO_HIWONDER**" is detected, and you'd like the program to print "**hello**" instead of the default message, follow the steps below. Navigate to the large_models directory and open the script with:

```
vim wakeup_demo.py
```

② Press i to enter INSERT mode (you'll see -- INSERT -- at the bottom of the screen). Locate the line '**print('hello hiwonder')**', and modify it to 'print('hello')'

```
i
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/03/image17.png"  />

③ Press ESC, then type **:wq** and press Enter to save and exit.

```
:wq
```

④ Finally, run the program with:

```
python3 wakeup_demo.py
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/03/image19.png"  />

If you'd like to create more advanced or customized wake words and voice commands, please refer to the document titled:  

"[**Appendix →  Firmware Flashing Tool → Creating Firmware for WonderEchoPro**](resources_download.md)".

* **Speech Recognition**

(1) What is Speech Recognition?

Speech Recognition (Speech-to-Text, STT) is a technology that converts human speech signals into text or executable commands. In this course, we will implement speech recognition functionality using Alibaba OpenAI's Speech Recognition API.

(2) How It Works

The wave library is used to extract audio data. The extracted audio is then sent to OpenAI's ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model. The recognized text returned by the ASR model is stored in speech_result for use in subsequent processes.

(3) Preparation Before the Experiment

Before proceeding, refer to the course "[**11.1.2 Large Speech Model Courses -> Large Language Models Deployment**](#anchor_11_2_1_2)" to obtain your API key, and make sure to add it into the configuration file (config).

(4) Experiment Steps

① Power on the device and connect to it using MobaXterm.  

(For detailed instructions, please refer to [Appendix ->Remote Connection Tools and Instructions](resources_download.md).)

② Navigate to the program directory by entering the following command:

```
cd large_models/
```

③ Open the configuration file to input your API Key by entering the command below. Press i to enter INSERT mode and enter your API Key. Once finished, press Esc, type :wq, and hit Enter to save and exit.

```
vim config.py
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/04/image3.png"  />

④ Run the speech recognition program with:

```
python3 openai_asr_demo.py
```

(5) Function Realization

After the program starts, the microphone will recognize the recorded audio content from the user and print the converted text output.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/04/image5.png"  />

(6) Brief Program Analysis

This program implements a speech recognition system by calling OpenAI's Speech-to-Text API to convert audio files into text.

The program source code is located at: [/home/ubuntu/large_models/openai_asr_demo.py](../_static/source_code/large_models_sdk.zip)

① Module Import

{lineno-start=6}

```
from speech import speech
```

The speech module encapsulates ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) functionalities, such as connecting to an external ASR service.

② Define ASR Class

{lineno-start=11}

```
asr = speech.RealTimeOpenAIASR()
```

This line creates a real-time speech recognition object named asr. The RealTimeOpenAIASR class is used to interact with the speech recognition service.

③ Speech Recognition Functionality

{lineno-start=13}

```
asr.update_session(model='whisper-1', language='en', threshold=0.2, prefix_padding_ms=300, silence_duration_ms=800) 
```

An ASR client object is created to prepare for invoking the speech recognition service.

The `asr.asr()` method is called to send the audio file (wav) to the ASR service for recognition.

The recognized result (typically text) is printed to the console.

(7) Function Extension

You can modify the model name to enable speech recognition in various languages, such as Chinese, English, Japanese, and Korean.

③ Then, run the program with the command:

```
python3 openai_asr_demo.py
```

④ Record a sample sentence such as "**Hello, can you hear me clearly?**", and the recognized text will be printed on the console.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/04/image12.png"  />

* **Speech Synthesis**

(1) What is Speech Synthesis?

Speech synthesis (SS) is a technology that converts written text into intelligible spoken audio. It enables computers to generate natural, human-like speech for communication or information delivery.

In this course, we will run a program that processes text using a large language model and generates corresponding audio.

(2) How It Works

The program first sends the text to the OpenAI TTS (Text-to-Speech) model. The model returns the generated audio data, which is saved as a file named tts_audio.wav for playback or storage.

(3) Preparation Before the Experiment

Refer to the course "[11.2.1 Large Language Models Courses -> Large Language Models Deployment](#anchor_11_2_1_2)" to obtain your API key, and update the configuration file accordingly.

(4) Experiment Steps

① Power on the device and connect to it using MobaXterm "(**refer to the [Appendix -> Remote Connection Tools and Instructions](resources_download.md) for detailed guidance**)".

② Navigate to the program directory by entering the following command:

```
cd large_models/
```

③ Open the configuration file to enter your API Key. After editing, press Esc, type :wq, and hit Enter to save and exit:

```
vim config.py
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/05/image3.png"  />

④ Finally, run the program with the following command:

```
python3 openai_tts_demo.py
```

(5) Function Realization

Upon running the program, it will play an audio message saying "**Hello, Can I Help You**", and simultaneously save the audio file with the same content to the following directory:  

[/home/ubuntu/large_models/resources/audio/](../_static/source_code/large_models_sdk.zip)

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/05/image5.png"  />

(6) Brief Program Analysis

This program is a speech synthesis system based on OpenAI's Text-to-Speech (TTS) API, capable of converting text into audio files. It supports input text and outputs audio in formats like PCM, WAV, FLAC, AAC, Opus, and MP3. By specifying the desired text, the program sends the request to the API and returns the synthesized audio, which can be played or saved locally.

The source code for this program is located at:  [/home/ubuntu/large_models/openai_tts_demo.py](../_static/source_code/large_models_sdk.zip)

① Module Import

{lineno-start=5}

```
from config import *
from speech import speech  
```

speech: This module encapsulates the TTS functionalities.

② Definition for TTS Class

{lineno-start=8}

```
tts = speech.RealTimeOpenAITTS()
tts.tts("Hello, Can I help you?") # https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech
tts.tts("Hello, Can I help you?", model="tts-1", voice="onyx", speed=1.0, instructions='Speak in a cheerful and positive tone.')
tts.save_audio("Hello, Can I help you?", model="gpt-4o-mini-tts", voice="onyx", speed=1.0, instructions='Speak in a cheerful and positive tone.', audio_format='wav', save_path="./resources/audio/tts_audio.wav")
```

`speed`: Specifies the playback speed; the default value is 1.

For intelligent real-time applications, it is recommended to use the gpt-4o-mini-tts model. 

Other available models include tts-1 and tts-1-hd. tts-1 offers lower latency but with slightly reduced quality compared to tts-1-hd.

Voice Options: nova, shimmer, echo, onyx, fable, alloy, ash, sage, coral.

For more details, you can refer to the OpenAI documentation:

<https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech>

③ Function Extension

To change the voice, follow these steps:

Step1 : Open the program by entering the command:

```
vim openai_tts_demo.py
```

Step2 : Press i on your keyboard to enter INSERT mode. Locate the line voice="**onyx**" and modify it to voice="**nova**".

```
i
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/05/image9.png"  />

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/05/image10.png"  />

Step3 : Press Esc, then type :wq and hit Enter to save and exit.

```
:wq
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/05/image11.png"  />

Step4 : Execute the program with the following command:

```
python3 openai_tts_demo.py
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/05/image12.png"  />

Once the program starts, the speaker will play the synthesized audio using the newly selected voice style.

* **Voice Interaction**

(1) What is Voice Interaction?

Voice Interaction (VI) refers to a method of communication between humans and computers or devices through spoken language. It integrates speech recognition and speech synthesis, enabling devices to both understand user commands and respond naturally, creating true two-way voice communication. To achieve natural voice interaction, factors such as semantic understanding and sentiment analysis must also be considered, allowing the system to accurately interpret user intent and provide appropriate responses.

This approach can be used as the foundation for developing our own AI assistant features.

(2) How It Works

First, the wake word detection module listens for a specific wake-up word. Once detected, it initiates audio recording. After recording, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) converts the audio into text, which is then sent to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an appropriate response. The generated text is subsequently converted into speech through a Text-to-Speech (TTS) module and played back to the user. This entire process enables seamless and natural interaction between the user and the voice assistant.

(3) Experiment Steps

① Power on the device and connect to it via MobaXterm (refer to Appendix "**[Remote Connection Tools and Instructions](resources_download.md)**" for connection guidance).

② To check the microphone's port number, first disconnect the microphone and run the command. Then reconnect the microphone and run the command again to determine the port number (Note: do not connect any other USB devices during this process).

```
ll /dev | grep USB
```

After disconnecting the microphone, no USB device should appear.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/06/image2.png"  />

Upon reconnecting the microphone, a USB port (e.g., ttyCH341USB1) will be listed (make sure to note this device name). The device name may vary depending on the main controller.

③ Navigate to the program directory:

```
cd large_models/
```

④ Open the configuration file to enter your API Key. After editing, press Esc, then type :wq and hit Enter to save and exit:

```
vim config.py
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/06/image4.png"  />

⑤ Enter the port number you obtained and modify the corresponding microphone port settings for either WonderEcho Pro or the six-microphone setup. Uncomment the configuration for the port you intend to use and comment out the settings for any unused ports.

```
vim openai_interaciton_demo.py
```

If you are using the WonderEcho Pro, modify the corresponding section:

If you are using the 6-Microphone Array, modify the relevant section:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/06/image5.png"  />

⑥ Run the program:

```
python3 openai_interaciton_demo.py
```

⑦ To stop the program at any time, simply press Ctrl+C.

(4) Function Realization

After successful execution, the voice device will announce 'I'm ready.' Then, upon hearing the wake-up word **'HELLO_HIWONDER,'** the device will respond with 'I'm here,' indicating that the assistant has been successfully awakened. You can now ask the AI assistant any questions:

For example: 'What are some fun places to visit in New York?'

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_2.2/06/image7.png"  />

(5) Brief Program Analysis

The program integrates voice recognition, speech synthesis, and intelligent response functionalities to create a voice assistant. Interaction is initiated through the wake-up word (HELLO_HIWONDER). Users can converse with the assistant via voice commands, and the assistant will respond using text-to-speech technology. The overall structure is clear, with distinct modules that are easy to expand and maintain.

The source code for this program is located at: [/home/ubuntu/large_models/openai_interaction_demo.py](../_static/source_code/large_models_sdk.zip)

(1) Module Import

{lineno-start=5}

```
import os
import time
from config import *
from speech import awake
from speech import speech
```

time: Used to control the interval between program executions.

speech: The core module, integrating wake-up word detection, speech activity detection, speech recognition, TTS, and LLM.

(2) Definition of Audio File Paths

{lineno-start=11}

```
wakeup_audio_path = './resources/audio/en/wakeup.wav'
start_audio_path = './resources/audio/en/start_audio.wav'
no_voice_audio_path = './resources/audio/en/no_voice.wav'
```

This section configures the audio file paths used by various functional modules, such as wake-up sounds, recording storage paths, and prompt sounds.

The text-to-speech (TTS) module is initialized to convert LLM responses into speech.

(3) Main Functional Logic

{lineno-start=33}

```
def main():
    kws.start()
    while True:
        try:
            if kws.wakeup(): # Wake word detected(检测到唤醒词)
                speech.play_audio(wakeup_audio_path)  # Play wake-up sound(唤醒播放)
                asr_result = asr.asr() # Start voice recognition(开启录音识别)
                print('asr_result:', asr_result)
                if asr_result:
                    # Send the recognition result to the agent for a response(将识别结果传给智能体让他来回答)
                    response = client.llm(asr_result, model='gpt-4o-mini')
                    print('llm response:', response)
                    tts.tts(response)
                else:
                    speech.play_audio(no_voice_audio_path)
            time.sleep(0.02)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            kws.exit() 
            try:
                os.system('pinctrl FAN_PWM a0')
            except:
                pass
            break
        except BaseException as e:
            print(e)
```

**Wake-up Detection:** Continuously monitors for the wake-up word. Once detected, it stops the wake-up detection and plays the wake-up prompt sound.

**Voice Processing:** Records and recognizes the user's speech, uses the language model to generate a response, and then converts the response into speech for playback.

**Error Handling:** Catches exit signals and runtime errors to ensure the program exits safely and releases resources.

### 11.2.3 Vision Language Model Courses

* **Overview of Vision Language Model**

Vision Language Model (VLM) integrate visual recognition capabilities into traditional Language Model (LLM), enabling more powerful interactions between vision and language through multimodal inputs.

(1) Basic Concept

Vision Language Model (VLM) are a type of artificial intelligence model that leverages deep learning techniques to learn from and process large-scale visual data. These models often adopt convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, enabling them to extract rich visual features from images or video streams and perform various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and facial recognition. In theory, VLM possess powerful capabilities in feature extraction and pattern recognition, making them widely applicable in fields like autonomous driving, facial recognition, and medical imaging analysis.

(2) Features

**Multimodal Input and Output**: VLM can process both images and text as input and generate various forms of output, including text, images, charts, and more.

**Powerful Visual-Semantic Understanding**: With extensive knowledge accumulated from large-scale visual datasets, VLMsexcel at tasks such as object detection, classification, and image captioning.

**Visual Question Answering (VQA):** VLM can engage in natural language conversations based on the content of input images, accurately answering vision-related questions.

**Image Generation:** Some advanced VLM are capable of generating simple image content based on given conditions.

**Deep Visual Understanding:** These models can recognize intricate details within images and explain underlying logical and causal relationships.

**Cross-Modal Reasoning:** VLM can leverage visual and linguistic information together, enabling reasoning across modalities, such as inferring from language to vision and vice versa.

**Unified Visual and Language Representation Space:** By applying attention mechanisms, VLM establish deep connections between visual and semantic information, achieving unified multimodal representations.

**Open Knowledge Integration:** VLM can integrate both structured and unstructured knowledge, enhancing their understanding of image content.

(3) How It Works

The working principle of Vision Language Model is primarily based on deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures. Through multiple layers of neurons, these models perform feature extraction and information processing, enabling them to automatically recognize and understand complex patterns within images.

In a VLM, the input image first passes through several convolutional layers, where local features such as edges, textures, and shapes are extracted. Each convolutional layer is typically followed by an activation function (e.g., ReLU) to introduce non-linearity, allowing the model to learn more complex representations. Pooling layers are often used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving important information, helping to optimize computational efficiency.

As the network deepens, it gradually transitions from extracting low-level features (like edges and corners) to higher-level features (such as objects and scenes). For classification tasks, the final feature vector is passed through fully connected layers to predict the probability of different target categories. For tasks like object detection and segmentation, the model outputs bounding boxes or masks to indicate the location and shape of objects within the image.

Transformer-based VLM divide images into small patches, treating them as sequential data, and apply self-attention mechanisms to capture global relationships within the image. This approach is particularly effective at modeling long-range dependencies, enabling VLM to excel at understanding complex visual scenes.

Training VLM typically requires large-scale labeled datasets. Through backpropagation, the model optimizes its parameters to minimize the loss between predictions and ground-truth labels. Pretraining on massive datasets allows the model to acquire general-purpose visual features, while fine-tuning on specific tasks further improves performance for specialized applications.

Thanks to this design, Visual Language Models are able to process and understand visual data effectively, and are widely used in applications like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation, driving rapid progress in the field of computer vision.

### 11.2.4 Multimodal Model Basic Courses

* **Overview of Multimodal Model**

The emergence of Multimodal Model is built upon continuous advancements in the fields of Large Language Model (LLM) and Vision Language Model (VLM).

(1) Basic Concept

As LLM continue to improve in language understanding and reasoning capabilities, techniques such as instruction tuning, in-context learning, and chain-of-thought prompting have become increasingly widespread. However, despite their strong performance on language tasks, LLM still exhibit notable limitations in perceiving and understanding visual information such as images. At the same time, VLM have made significant strides in visual tasks such as image segmentation and object detection, and can now be guided by language instructions to perform these tasks, though their reasoning abilities still require further enhancement.

(2) Features

The core strength of Multimodal Model lies in their ability to understand and manipulate visual content through language instructions. Through pretraining and fine-tuning, these models learn the associations between different modalities—such as how to generate descriptions from images or how to identify and classify objects in visual data. Leveraging self-attention mechanisms from deep learning, Multimodal Model can effectively capture relationships across modalities, allowing them to synthesize information from multiple sources during reasoning and decision-making processes.

**Multimodal Fusion Capability:** Multimodal Model can process and understand multiple types of data simultaneously, including text, images, and audio. This fusion ability enables the models to build connections across modalities, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of information. For instance, a model can generate natural language descriptions based on an image or identify specific objects within an image based on a text query.

**Enhanced Contextual Understanding:** By integrating information from different modalities, Multimodal Model excel at contextual understanding. They can not only recognize content within a single modality but also combine clues from multiple sources to make more accurate judgments and decisions in complex tasks.

**Flexible Interaction Methods:** Users can interact with Multimodal Model through natural language instructions, making communication with the models more intuitive without requiring knowledge of complex programming or operations. For example, users can simply ask about details in an image, and the model can provide relevant answers.

**Scalability:** The architecture and training methods of Multimodal Model allow them to adapt to new modalities and tasks. As technology evolves, additional types of data—such as videos or sensor readings—can be incorporated, expanding their range of applications and capabilities.

**Strong Generative Capabilities:** Similar to large language models, Multimodal Model perform exceptionally well in generating both textual and visual content. They can produce natural language descriptions, summaries, and even create novel visual outputs, meeting a wide variety of application needs.

**Improved Reasoning Abilities:** Although challenges remain, Multimodal Model demonstrate significantly enhanced reasoning capabilities compared to traditional single-modality models. By integrating multimodal information, they can reason effectively in more complex scenarios, supporting advanced tasks such as logical reasoning and sentiment analysis.

**Adaptability and Personalization:** Multimodal Model can be fine-tuned to meet user-specific needs and preferences, enabling highly personalized services. This adaptability offers great potential for applications in fields such as education, entertainment, and customer service.

(3) How It Works

The working principle of Multimodal Model is built upon advanced deep learning and neural network technologies, with a core focus on fusing data from different modalities to understand and tackle complex tasks. At the foundation, Multimodal Model often adopt architectures similar to Transformers, which are highly effective at capturing relationships between different parts of input data. During training, these models are exposed to massive amounts of multimodal data—such as images, text, and audio—and leverage large-scale unsupervised learning for pretraining. Through this process, the models learn the commonalities and differences across modalities, enabling them to grasp the intrinsic connections between various types of information.

In practice, incoming text and visual data are first embedded into a shared representation space. Text inputs are transformed into vectors using word embedding techniques, while images are processed through methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract visual features. These vectors are then fed into the model's encoder, where self-attention mechanisms analyze the relationships across modalities, identifying and focusing on the most relevant information.

After encoding, the model generates a multimodal contextual representation that blends both the semantic information of the text and the visual features of the image. When a user provides a natural language instruction, the MLLM parses the input and interprets the intent by leveraging the contextual representation. This process involves reasoning and generation capabilities, allowing the model to produce appropriate responses based on its learned knowledge, or to perform specific actions in visual tasks.

Finally, the Multimodal Model's decoder translates the processed information into outputs that users can easily understand—such as generating textual descriptions or executing targeted visual operations. Throughout this process, the emphasis is on the fusion and interaction of information across different modalities, enabling Multimodal Model to excel at handling complex combinations of natural language and visual content. This integrated working mechanism empowers Multimodal Model with powerful functionality and flexibility across a wide range of application scenarios.

(4) Application Scenarios

① Education

Multimodal Model can be used to create personalized learning experiences. By combining text and visual content, the model can provide students with rich learning materials—for example, explaining scientific concepts through a mix of images and text to enhance understanding. Additionally, in online courses, the model can dynamically adjust content based on the learner's performance, offering customized learning suggestions in real time.

② Healthcare

Multimodal Model can assist doctors in diagnosis and treatment decisions. By analyzing medical images (such as X-rays or MRIs) alongside relevant medical literature, the model helps doctors access information more quickly and provides evidence-based recommendations. This application improves diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

③ Entertainment

Multimodal Model can be used for content generation, such as automatically creating stories, scripts, or in-game dialogues. By incorporating visual elements, the model can provide rich scene descriptions for game developers, enhancing immersion. Additionally, on social media platforms, Multimodal Model can analyze user-generated images and text to help recommend suitable content.

④ Advertising and Marketing

Multimodal Model can analyze consumer behavior and preferences to generate personalized advertising content. By combining text and images, ads can better capture the attention of target audiences and improve conversion rates.

Finally, Multimodal Model also play a role in scientific research. By processing large volumes of literature and image data, the model can help researchers identify trends, generate hypotheses, or summarize findings, accelerating scientific discovery.

* **Access Live Camera Feed (Optional)**

:::{Note}
*   Command input is case-sensitive and space-sensitive.
*   Before starting the camera feed, make sure the Intelligent Line Following feature is running properly. Otherwise, the camera feed may fail to launch.
:::

After the feature is activated, you can view the camera feed in a browser by enabling the **"web_video_server"** service.

(1) After the program starts successfully, open the system browser and enter `192.168.149.1:8080` in the address bar. Press **Enter** to access the **"web_video_server"** backend.

```
192.168.149.1:8080
```

(2) Then, click the `color_detection/image_result` button to open the camera feed interface for the visual tracking feature.

* **Project Outcome**

After the feature is activated, you can phrase your command freely—for example: **"Track the purple ball."** ROSMan will automatically track the purple ball within its field of view. The ball will be highlighted on screen, and once it reaches the center of the frame, the robot will stop tracking.

### 11.4.5 Transporting in Embodied AI Applications

* **Introduction**

`KWS` (Keyword Spotting) is used to detect whether the user has spoken a specific wake word. `KWS` can be integrated with `ASR` to enable more comprehensive voice recognition.

Then, `ASR` is used to convert the audio signal into text. After the wake word is detected, the system records the user's voice and performs speech recognition.

After recognizing the speech, the system retrieves an image from the image queue and sends both the recognized text and image to the `AI` agent to generate a response.

Finally, the `TTS` (Text-to-Speech) module converts the response text into speech and saves it as an audio file for playback.

* **Getting Started**

(1) Confirm Firmware for Integrated Microphone

The default firmware shipped with the expansion board microphone uses the wake word **"Hello, Hiwonder."** For reference, see: [11.1.2 Firmware Flashing](#anchor_11_1_2).

(2) Configuring the Large Model API-KEY

By default, the program does not include the configuration of the Large Model-related API keys. Before activating features related to the Large AI Model, please refer to the section **"[11.3.1 Obtain and Configure the Large Model API Key](#anchor_11_3)"** to configure the necessary keys. This step is mandatory and cannot be skipped, as it is crucial for the proper functioning and experience of the large model features.

(3) Network Configuration

The robot must be connected to the Internet during this feature, either in STA (LAN) mode or AP (direct connection) mode via Ethernet. For network configuration, refer to:[3. ROS Robot Motion Basic Control Course -\> 3.1.4 Network Configuration](3.ROS_Robot_Motion_Basic_Control_Course.md#network-configuration).

* **Enabling and Disabling the Feature**

:::{Note}
*   Command input is case-sensitive and space-sensitive.
*   The robot must be connected to the Internet, either in STA (LAN) mode or AP (direct connection) mode via Ethernet.
:::

(1) To start the ROSMan robot, refer to [3. ROS Robot Motion Basic Control Course -\> 3.1.1 Remote Desktop Tool Installation and Connection](3.ROS_Robot_Motion_Basic_Control_Course.md#remote-desktop-tool-installation-and-connection), and connect the robot to the VNC remote control software.

(2) Open the command-line terminal<img src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_4/05/image2.png"  />, enter the command and press Enter to disable ros service.

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(3) Enter the following command and press Enter to start the feature.

```
roslaunch large_models_examples vllm_transport_control.launch
```

(4) When the robot says **"I'm ready"** and you see the following output in the terminal, it means the program is running successfully.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_4/05/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(5) After the program starts successfully, say the wake word **"Hello, Hiwonder"** to activate the large language model. The robot will respond with the voice prompt **"I'm here."** Then, you can give a command to the robot, such as: **"Place the red block to the right of the green block."** Once the robot successfully recognizes the command, the terminal will print the corresponding text and the robot will also speak the response out loud.

(6) To exit the feature, press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal.

(7) When disabled the feature, open a terminal <img src="../_static/media/chapter_11/section_4/05/image6.png"   /> on the robot and enter the command to start the auto-start service. Then restart the mobile app and wait for the service to fully initialize.

```
sudo systemctl restart start_node.service
```

```

(2) Then, click the `color_detection/image_result` button to open the camera feed interface for the visual tracking feature.

* **Project Outcome**

After the wake-up is successful, the robot will announce **"I'm here."** You can then issue commands to the robot. The terminal will print the recognized text, and the robot will also read the text aloud. For example, **"Place the red block to the right of the green block."** The robot will respond with **"Got it."** It will then activate the camera to identify the corresponding colored blocks, pick up the red block first, and place it to the right of the green block.

:::{Note}
After a successful wake-up, the terminal will start printing the recognized speech content. If no command is spoken during this time, the robot will say: **"I didn't catch that, please say it again."** Once a command is spoken and successfully recognized, the recognized result will be printed as shown in the figure below, which helps you confirm whether the robot has received the command.
